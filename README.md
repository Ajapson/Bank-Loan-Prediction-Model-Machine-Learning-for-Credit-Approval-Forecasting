ðŸš€ Bank Loan Prediction Model

Unlocking the Mystery Behind Loan Approvals with Python & Machine Learning

ðŸŒŸ Overview

Ever applied for a bank loan and wondered, â€œWhy wasnâ€™t it approved?"
This project is designed to answer that question. Using Machine Learning, this model predicts whether a loan application will be Approved or Not Approved based on historical data, helping banks make data-driven decisions and customers understand the factors behind approvals or rejections.

Think of it as a smart forecasting system for banking, transforming raw data into actionable insights and predicting future outcomes with confidence.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
